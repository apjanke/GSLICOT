GSLICOT
=======

GSLICOT is a GPL (GNU Public License) fork of the SLICOT 4.x series.

This project exists because while SLICOT 4.5 was licensed under the GPL, SLICOT 5.x [changed to a non-Free commercial/academic-use-only license](https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses#If_the_license_isn.27t_on_this_list).
This project is a fork based on the last released GNU-licensed SLICOT so that development and maintenance can continue under the GPL.

## License

GNU Public License 3.0.
